College Management System 

“ON-LINE 
CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
FOR 
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES”


PROJECT OVERVIEW
	Likewise other departments in Govt College Women University (GCWU), management staff and faculty of department of Information Technology (IT) are creating and managing documents manually. 
	Most of the work is done without automation; it seems to be difficult to manage files manually and to communication them so the concerned persona may retriever information timely. 
	Our concept is to develop a web based content management system (CMS) for department of IT that will not only generate the required content but will also manage it efficiently.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
	Many open source CMS are available that can be used to manage different documents. Content editors are those who are privileged to edit and manage the content of website. Site administrator is the person who approves the content and its modifications after reviewing it. There can be more than one content editor but one site administrator of CMS. 
RELATED WORK
	KAU MARZ is CMS rather it is purely developed for King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It is highly extensive CMS used to manage and create university tasks. 
	CMS deployed at Mohammad Ali Jinnah University (MAJU), likewise MARZ, but not an open source CMS. It consists of UMS and SMU that manages the content of university like enrollment of students in particular courses, evaluation of teachers, online grading and assessment, manage attendance of students, managing time table, managing course content of website, electronic notice board and task management system that keep the tasks  and their status in check.
	In order to assist management staff and faculty, an initiative has been taken to automate some of the tasks that will reduce burden. No work has been implemented in this area yet. It is the need of hour to develop secure system that is easy to use and requires no special user training.
PROJECT SCOPE
The proposed CMS will be developed to help the University management, managerial staff, faculty and students in accessing and managing the content of department of IT, GCWU. 
PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
	The main objectives of the CMS are to provide access to various users to upload such information which is required by the other concerned departments, students and concerned persons. The concerned persons and departments will be able to upload their documents from their login at certain navigational options which will be reserved for them. The previous files will be available as archived files. 
	The reason to develop that CMS is to provide integrated environment so that information about all the aspects like admissions, important dates, updates, schedules, can be easily downloaded by the visitors. The file can be downloaded in pdf format.
•	Display Semester Schedules like start of semester, mid exam, final exam.
•	Important dates like date of enrollment, fee submission, add and drop subject.
•	Date Sheet of all the disciplines, discipline wise navigations. 
•	Digital Notice Board will be available for general and specific notices, discipline wise, semester wise, date wise.
•	Final Year Projects to be selected from the given choices, their selection and finalization.
•	Result Semester Mid Exam, Final Exam.
•	Sports and other curricular, extra-curricular and co-curricular activities.
•	Proformas which are required by the students for different purposes.
DEVELOPMENT TOOLS: 
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), Html, CSS, Java script,  JQuery and Ajax will be used in the project. MySQL will be used as backend database. MySQL is a relational database management system and is the most flexible and cost effective way to manage information for online applications. 
The following block diagram shows the organization of the proposed system.

USERS:
1.	Administrator, responsible for validation of all the contents to be published. Managing resources and privileges.
2.	Content manager and writer, responsible for updating contents, these are the persons who mostly interact with the system in order to upload file and other relevant material. They can be from the management side, administration, teaching faculty and some authorize students.
3.	Viewer, they can download or view the contents.
CONCLUSION
	It is need of time to develop a system for the department of IT that will serve the department’s managerial staff, faculty and students. Finalizing a schedule at start of semester manually often leads to clashes in connection with non-availability of class rooms, and teachers. From where the updated contents will be available.
	Similarly, designing date sheet for final and mid semester exams is a complex task. There may be an enrollment form, discipline wise, semester wise, duly approved by the department as which courses are offered during the semester. 
	Moreover, students most of the time unaware some important announcements made by teachers or may miss any notice being displayed on the notice board. 
	Many applications are rejected due to being written in inappropriate format. This CMS will provide the solution by uploaded different forms and will assist the students to download the applications and print them. 
	By maintaining the list of FYPs every year, students will get motivation to work on new ideas or enhance the previous work. The proposed system will not only display the information mentioned above but also allows privileged users to manage and maintain the website without requiring technical information. This will be a benchmark in the history of GCWU. Teacher’s Evaluation System can also be automated within the department of IT as future enhancement.
